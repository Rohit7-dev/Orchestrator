2.4.3 Cloud machines
I used AWS (Amazon web services) machines to perform the functions on remote machines they can be of any cloud providers we need to setup cloud Azure cloud, GCP (Google cloud platform), Alibaba cloud, etc.
- Setting Up AWS Machines:
1. Logging into AWS: First things first, head over to the AWS website and log into your account. If you don't have one, you'll need to sign up – it's straightforward.
2. Launching an Instance: Once you're logged in, you'll find yourself in the AWS Management Console. Navigate to the EC2 service, and from there, you can launch your instance. It's like giving birth to your very own virtual machine!
3. Choosing the Operating System: Now comes the fun part – choosing the operating system for your instance. AWS offers a variety of options, from the trusty Amazon Linux to Windows Server. Take your pick based on your needs and preferences.
4. Configuring the Instance: Next, you'll need to configure your instance. This involves setting up things like network settings, storage options, security groups (which act like virtual firewalls), and IAM roles (which control who can do what with your instance).
5. Review and Launch: Once you've configured everything to your liking, it's time to review your set-tings and hit that "Launch" button. Exciting, right?
6. Creating a Key Pair: Before your instance is up and running, AWS will ask you to create a key pair. This is like a secret handshake that allows you to securely connect to your instance later on.
7. Accessing Your Instance: Congratulations, your instance is now up and running in the vast expanse of the AWS cloud! You can access it using SSH (for Linux instances) or RDP (for Windows instances) using the provided key pair and public IP address.
- Amazon Elastic IP:
Amazon Elastic IP (EIP) is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides static IPv4 ad-dresses for your cloud resources. Consider this your permanent home in AWS's vast digital domain. Elastic IP addresses allow you to easily associate them with EC2 instances for seamless connectivity and easy management. Ideal for situations where your application needs a consistent IP address, such as hosting a website, establishing a VPN connection, or making sure your service is secure. Additional-ly, Elastic IP addresses are flexible; You can quickly reassign them to different instances in the virtual private cloud (VPC) to meet changing needs. The best part? There is no additional cost to having an Elastic IP address associated with the operation; this is useful for maintaining a stable and reliable con-nection to the AWS Cloud.
Amazon Elastic IP – it's like having a super reliable and flexible phone number for your AWS re-sources, following are few of the advantages of the same.
1. Static IP Address: Elastic IP gives you a static IPv4 address that you can keep for as long as you want. It's like having your own personal piece of the internet.
2. Flexibility: You can easily associate your Elastic IP address with any instance in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It's kind of like moving your phone number to a new phone – quick and painless.
3. Cost: While there's no charge for having an Elastic IP address associated with an instance, you might incur some costs if you leave it unattached or associated with a stopped instance for too long. Just something to keep in mind.
4. Use Cases: Elastic IP is perfect for hosting websites, setting up VPN connections, or ensuring high availability for your applications. It's basically your secret weapon for keeping things running smoothly in the AWS cloud.
Why was elastic IP by AWS used?
Ans – When connecting to an AWS instance via SSH (topic - 2.5) from a Python script, the state of the instance and the computers are constantly changing, causing the IP address to change. This can lead to uncertainty about the identity of the machine. However, Elastic IP addresses come into play by providing the flexibility to maintain consistent addresses.
Elastic IP ensures that the IP address remains constant even if the identity of the computer changes. This means that Elastic IP addresses play a trusted role regardless of changes in the instance or de-ployment. It provides uninterrupted connectivity by enabling external routing systems to seamlessly direct traffic to the destination.
In fact, Elastic IP Addressing is a reliable solution for managing IP addresses in an AWS environment, ensuring consistent communication and good access even in case of changes or machine settings.
2.5 SSH (Secure shell)
Secure Shell (SSH) is an encrypted network protocol that provides a secure way to access and control remote computers or servers over an unsecured network. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between clients and servers, making it an essential tool for administrators, developers, and others who require access to computing facilities.
- How to connect to a remote computer using SSH:
1. Activate a terminal or command prompt:
First, open a terminal or command prompt on the local computer. Here you can enter SSH commands to connect to the remote computer.
2. SSH command syntax:
The basic syntax of SSH commands is:
ssh [username] @ [hostname or IP address]
3. Command example:
For example, if your username is "user" and the IP address of the remote computer is "192.168.1.108", the SSH command would be:
ssh user@192.168.1.108
4. Authentication:
After entering the SSH message command, the system will ask you to enter the username specified on the remote control. computer. password. Alternatively, you can use authentication as a key for addi-tional security.
5. Connection completed:
Once you enter the correct password (or key-based authentication is completed), you will be connect-ed to the remote computer via SSH. You will now see a command prompt indicating that you are logged in to the remote computer.
2.5.1 Python syntax for SSH to AWS machine
Using Python to connect to your computer via SSH and Elastic IP address opens a world of possibili-ties for remote management and automation. It's like having a digital bridge that securely connects your physical environment to your cloud instance. By leveraging Python's Paramiko library, you'll have the tools you need to easily navigate this digital space. Imagine seamless access to your AWS activi-ties regardless of changing IP dynamics, with Elastic IP a steady foothold in a changing ocean. Take control of that music with a Python script that lets you execute commands from the comfort of your home and work on a remote computer. It is like remote management of your cloud-based infrastruc-ture; It allows you to work with a few lines of rules, manage resources and unlock the full capabilities of AWS operations.
1. Import paramiko library for SSH functionality.
2. Define necessary parameters such as Elastic IP, main path of private data and username.
3. Use paramiko.SSHCclient() to create an SSH client.
4. The host's key policy is set to retrieve lost keys.
5. This script attempts to connect to the AWS instance using the connect() method.
6. To execute SSH commands remotely, use the exec_command command (in this case, write the directory contents) ().
7. Watch for possible exceptions such as authentication failure or SSH error. Finally, use the close() method to close the SSH connection.
